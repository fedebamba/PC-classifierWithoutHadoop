# PC-classifierWithoutHadoop
A really simple implementatio of a twitter sentiment analyser, written in Java and complete with both a sequential and a parallel version.

Honestly, this implementation is not intended to be a competitive sentiment analyser; as the name suggests, it was developed almost only to compare its execution time with an Hadoop implementation of the same sentiment analyzer
